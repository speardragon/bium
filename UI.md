Overall Style & Mood: A clean, minimalist modern web application UI screenshot in a light theme. The design language should be clean and professional, using a flat design approach with subtle skeuomorphic elements to emphasize the physical container metaphor of time queues. The color palette focuses on calming blues, greens, and neutral greys, with striking red used only for warnings.

Layout & Structure: A 2-column dashboard layout. The left sidebar is a narrower panel for the "Task Inbox," and the large main content area on the right is the "Weekly Plan View."

Left Sidebar (Task Inbox): A clean panel titled "Inbox." Below the title, there is an input field labeled "Add a new task..." with a small clock icon next to it, indicating a required time estimation. Below the input, a list of draggable task cards is shown. Each task card is a solid, rounded rectangular block in a neutral grey color, displaying a task title (e.g., "Write Blog Post") and a prominent duration label (e.g., "60m", "30m"). They look like physical blocks ready to be picked up.

Main Content Area (Weekly Plan View - The Queues): A grid-based calendar view displaying columns for "Mon," "Tue," "Wed," etc. Under each day column, there are several large, distinct time containers called "Queues."

Visual Detail of the "Queues" (The Core Concept):

Empty Queue State (e.g., Wed 9-11 AM): A rectangular container with a dashed blue border and a transparent background. Inside, there is a faint, subtle background graphic resembling an empty water tank with level markers (0%, 50%, 100%). Placeholder text in the center says "Deep Work Queue (2h Capacity)". It looks inviting, ready to be filled.

Filled Queue State (e.g., Mon 9-11 AM): A container with a solid blue border. The background inside shows a dynamic liquid-fill progress bar effect, currently filled up to 70% with a calming blue liquid. Floating inside this blue liquid are several solid task blocks (dragged from the Inbox), stacked vertically like bricks. A label at the top reads "Deep Work (1h 30m / 2h)". The remaining 30% empty space at the top has a subtle diagonal hatch pattern, labeled "Buffer (30m)".

Overfilled Warning Queue State (e.g., Tue 2-4 PM): A container with an intense, flashing red dashed border. The liquid inside is red and is visually overflowing the top rim of the container. Task blocks are stacked inside, and the top block is partially spilling out of the container's frame, with a red warning icon and text saying "OVER Capacity! (-30m)". This state clearly communicates a time constraint violation.

Interaction Details: A mouse cursor is visibly dragging a task block labeled "Email Cleanup (30m)" from the left Inbox sidebar towards an Empty Queue on the Wednesday column. The being-dragged block has a slight drop shadow and is semi-transparent, while the target Empty Queue has a highlighting glow effect, indicating it's ready to accept the drop.

Typography & Icons: Clean, modern sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto). Simple, universally recognizable line icons for clocks, calendars, and warnings.
